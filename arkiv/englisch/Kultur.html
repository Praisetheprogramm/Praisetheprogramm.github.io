                <h1>Language</h1>
                <p>
                    In New Zealand it is important to prepare for the linguistic experience because in New Zealand people don't just speak English. 4% of the population speak Te Reo Maori, the language of the indigenous people. The other 96% speak English, which is very reminiscent of British English. Unfortunately, even deaf people are not spared from the wide cultural differences because the New Zealand language is a little different to the British language, so misunderstandings can occur there too

                <p>
                    The Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. They belonged to the Kanaka Maoli who live in Hawaii. In the 13th century they traveled to New Zealand and settled there. The Maori can often be recognized by striking tattoos and loud dances. The Maori culture also has A strong influence on daily life in New Zealand as Te Reo Māori is an official language in New Zealand, one is often greeted with “Kia Ora” and some of the Maori culture's traditions are quite important in the larger culture of New Zealand such as Manaakitanga (warm hospitality ) and Kaitiakitanga (guardianship over the country) New Zealand culture is fundamentally characterized by a “she'll be right” (that's fitting). New Zealanders are known for being friendly, light-hearted and stress-free

                    Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. They have a very traditional method of preparing meals for special occasions: the “Māori Hāngī”. Stones are heated in a pit in the ground and potatoes, vegetables and meat are then added.

                <p>
                    There are a comparatively large number of non-religious people living in New Zealand. In the 2013 census, 55% of the total population professed to have (at least) one religion - including 48.9% Christians - while 42% stated that they did not belong to any religion. The most common Christian denominations are the Roman Catholic (12.6%), the Anglican (11.8%) and the Presbyterian Church (8.5%); Another 5.5% described themselves as Christians without specifying a specific denomination. The Ringatū Church and the Ratana movement, which were founded by Māori, are also part of Christianity (1.4%).

                <h1>Sport</h1>
                <p>
                    Sport plays a very important role in New Zealand. New Zealand is a world leader in the Commonwealth's most important sports - rugby, cricket and netball. At the Summer Olympics and the Commonwealth Games, New Zealand regularly wins a relatively high number of medals - given its small population. From the 1950s to the 1980s, New Zealand repeatedly produced some outstanding track and field athletes, especially middle and long-distance runners and javelin throwers. With Arthur Lydiard there was also a coach whose system was ahead of its time.[126] The shot putter Valerie Adams (sometimes under the name Valerie Vili) is currently one of the world's best.

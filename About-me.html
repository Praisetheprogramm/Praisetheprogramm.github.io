        <p>
            I was born in Germany and attended secondary school there until the seventh grade. After that, I moved to Norway and began an apprenticeship at Amalie Skram in the field of information technology and media. I specialized in the technical programming branch of this apprenticeship. I can understand and speak German, Norwegian, and English fluently.
